# Assignment 7 — Pareto Visualisation

**Key methods:** Parallel coordinates · GeoPandas · RICE-50 world maps · Trade-off analysis

---

## Learning objectives

1. Visualise the **cross-seed reference set** from Assignment 6 using interactive **parallel coordinates** plots (Plotly).
2. Create **world-map** choropleth visualisations of regional welfare outcomes for selected policies (GeoPandas + RICE-50 regions).
3. Identify and articulate the key **trade-offs** in the objective space — which objectives are in conflict? Which are aligned?
4. Select a shortlist of **candidate policies** (typically 3–5) for robustness analysis in Assignment 8.

## Prerequisites

- **Assignment 6 completed** — the cross-seed reference set (`reference_set_utilitarian.csv`) is required.

## Key packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `plotly` | Interactive parallel coordinates and scatter plots |
| `geopandas` | World map choropleth (RICE-50 regional resolution) |
| `kaleido` | Static export of Plotly figures to PNG/PDF |

## Submission

Submit `A7_<studentnumber>.ipynb` via Brightspace with all cells executed. Make sure Plotly figures are visible (either static exports or inline widgets).
