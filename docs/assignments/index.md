# 📝 Assignments

There are **eight graded assignments** in EPA141A. They form a **single end-to-end MBDM pipeline** applied to the **JUSTICE** climate–economy model. Each assignment builds on outputs saved by the previous one — work through them in order.

```{warning}
**Do not skip assignments.** Later assignments (A7, A8) load files produced in A6. A6 depends
on A5, which depends on A4. Skipping any assignment breaks the pipeline.
```

## Assignment pipeline

```
A1 → ensemble runs saved to results/
A2 → reads A1 ensemble → sensitivity indices
A3 → reads A1 ensemble → scenario boxes
A4 → defines objectives & policy structure → config_student.json
A5 → runs MOEA → Pareto CSVs in results/
A6 → merges A5 seeds → reference_set.csv
A7 → reads A6 reference set → plots & maps
A8 → reads A6 reference set → robustness metrics
```

## JUSTICE deep uncertain parameters (Assignments 1–3)

In the first three assignments the policy is **fixed** and you explore how model uncertainty affects outcomes.

| Parameter | Description | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `ECS` | Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (°C per CO₂ doubling) | 2.0 – 5.0 |
| `damage_scale` (δ) | Scales the Kalkuhl damage function globally | 0.5 – 2.0 |
| `scenario` | SSP-RCP pair (socioeconomic + emissions pathway) | 8 combinations |
| `welfare_function` | Distributive justice principle for the scalar objective | 8 options |
| `discount_rate` (ρ) | Pure time preference rate | 0.001 – 0.05 |
| `utility_elasticity` (η) | Diminishing marginal utility of consumption | 0.5 – 3.0 |

From Assignment 4 onward the **emission control rate** itself becomes the decision lever, optimised across the 57 RICE-50 regions by a many-objective evolutionary algorithm.

## JUSTICE model outcomes

| Outcome | Description | Goal |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `temperature_overshoot` | Years global mean temperature exceeds 2 °C | Minimise |
| `welfare` | Scalar social welfare (depends on welfare function) | Maximise |
| `consumption_loss` | Cumulative consumption loss relative to no-policy baseline | Minimise |
| `gini_consumption` | Gini coefficient of per-capita consumption across regions | Minimise |
| `abatement_cost` | Cumulative global abatement cost (% of gross world product) | Minimise |

```{note}
The same emission policy can rank **very differently** depending on which welfare function is
applied. This normative uncertainty is a central theme of the JUSTICE assignments.

## Submission guidelines

- Submit via **Brightspace** as a `.ipynb` file with all cells executed.
- Include your **student number** in the filename: `A1_5xxxxxx.ipynb`.
- All code must be reproducible: restart kernel → run all cells → no errors.
- Select the **`EPA141A (JUSTICE)`** kernel before submitting.
- Late penalty: **−10 % per 24 h** unless an extension is agreed in advance.
